        <p>The P and DIV elements both are block level element,and they will always starts ona new line  and take up the full width avilable (stretches out to the left and right as far as it can.)</p>
        <p>A block level element always starts one a new line, and the browsers automatically add some space(a margin) before and after the element.</p>
        <div>A block-level element always takes up the full width avilable.</div>

            <h2>Chandrayaan-3</h2>
            <p><address>Chandrayaan-3</address> is a follow-on mission to Chandrayaan-2 to demonstrate end-to-end capability in safe landing and roving on the lunar surface. It consists of Lander and Rover configuration. It will be launched by LVM3 from SDSC SHAR, Sriharikota. The propulsion module will carry the lander and rover configuration till 100 km lunar orbit. The propulsion module has Spectro-polarimetry of Habitable Planet Earth (SHAPE) payload to study the spectral and Polari metric measurements of Earth from the lunar orbit.

                <h4>Lander payloads:</h4> Chandraâ€™s Surface Thermophysical Experiment (ChaSTE) to measure the thermal conductivity and temperature; Instrument for Lunar Seismic Activity (ILSA) for measuring the seismicity around the landing site; Langmuir Probe (LP) to estimate the plasma density and its variations. A passive Laser Retroreflector Array from NASA is accommodated for lunar laser ranging studies.
                
                <h4>Rover payloads:</h4> Alpha Particle X-ray Spectrometer (APXS) and Laser Induced Breakdown Spectroscope (LIBS) for deriving the elemental composition in the vicinity of landing site.</p>

        <p>Chandrayaan-3 is the <span style="color:blue;">third</span> and most recent lunar exploration mission under Chandrayaan programme. It consists of a lander named <span style="color: blue;">Vikram</span> and a rover named <span style="color: blue;">Pragyan</span> similar to Chandrayaan-2, but does not have an <b>orbiter</b>. Its propulsion module behaves like a <span style="background-color:pink;">communication relay satellite</span> .The propulsion module carries the lander and rover configuration until the spacecraft is in a<span style="font-family: Impact, Haettenschweiler, 'Arial Narrow Bold', sans-serif;">100 km</span> lunar orbit.

            Following Chandrayaan-2, where a last-minute glitch in the landing guidance software led to the lander crashing after entering lunar orbit, another lunar mission was proposed.
            
            The launch of Chandrayaan-3 took place on <q>14 July 2023, at 2:35 pm</q> IST and lunar injection of <small>100 km circular polar orbit</small> was completed successfully as part of phase one.The lander and rover are expected to land near the lunar south pole region on<i>23 August 2023.</i>
            
            The Chandrayaan-3 mission is a stepping stone towards<abbr title="Indian Space Research Organisation">ISROs</abbr> future interplanetary missions.</p>
